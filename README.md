## Introduction

This repository contains the homeworks and the projects done in the advanced
computer graphics class. This objective of this class was to develop a physically
based rendered in C++ called [Nori](http://wjakob.github.io/nori/).
A minimalistic ray tracer was provided on which we build up through the homeworks
and the project. All the development was done individually both for the homeworks
and the projects and no solutions were provided for the assignments.
